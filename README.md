This is a very simple GraphQL Ruby / React on Rails example app that leverages the back end rails API laid out in the [How To GraphQL â€“ GraphQL Ruby tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-ruby/0-introduction/) written by [Radoslav Stankov](https://twitter.com/rstankov). This project extends that tutorial by implementing a React on Rails front end with Apollo Client to hit the rails server and Apollo Link-State to manage local application state. It's mostly a Front End exercise, but I added several Ruby GraphQL queries, types, and mutations to get a feel for things.
