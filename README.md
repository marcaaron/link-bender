## React on Rails & GraphQL Ruby Example Project

*In Progress...*

This is a very simple React on Rails example app that leverages the back end rails API laid out in the [How To GraphQL â€“ GraphQL Ruby tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-ruby/). It extends that project by implementing a React on Rails client with Apollo Client to hit the rails server and Apollo Link-State to manage local application state.

**Basic Features:**

- User Accounts
- Session Authorization
- Creating Links
- Voting on Links

**Tools Used:**

[GraphQL Ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby)

[React on Rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails)

[Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
